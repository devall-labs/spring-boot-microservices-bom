# Microservices POM
This repository contains the common pom.xml file used across all microservices in the Microservices project. It serves 
as a centralized source of dependencies, plugins, and configuration management, promoting the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) 
principle. By using this shared pom, individual microservices can inherit common settings and dependencies, ensuring 
consistency and reducing duplication across the project.
